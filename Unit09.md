**Unit 9: Perimeter and Area** <span id="9"></span> 
*Two of the most common applications of Geometry are area and
perimeter.  Owning a home gives you plenty of opportunities to use these
concepts.  Thinking of buying a cordless electric lawnmower?  The
manufacturer will give you an estimate of the mower’s battery life using
square feet.  If your yard is extremely large and your mower’s battery
life is not long enough, it might take you multiple sessions to get it
all mowed.  Are you buying new carpeting for your home?  It is sold in
square feet or square yards.  You definitely do not want to buy too much
carpeting or too little carpeting.  You are not just going to eyeball it
and make a guess.  You will want to measure everything carefully, and
then order a bit more, giving yourself some leeway.*  
  
 *Like area, perimeter is often used in home ownership.  If you install
fencing around your yard, you are going to calculate the perimeter
before you buy the fencing.  If you are forced to run wiring around the
walls of a room, it is vital that you know how much wiring you will
need.*
