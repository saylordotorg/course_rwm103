**Unit 8: Circles** <span id="8"></span> 
*Circles are everywhere you look, for example, tires, pools, fans, and
watches.  You can probably think of several more items that are
circular.  In this unit, you will learn about circles and arcs, which
are slices of the edge of a circle.*  
  
 *Believe it or not, arcs are used a lot in real life.  The feet of a
rocking chair are arcs; the crust on a slice of pizza is an arc. 
Anything that looks like an incomplete circle is an arc.  How are these
arcs made?  What kinds are there?  How can we measure them?  These are
questions that you will explore in this unit.*
