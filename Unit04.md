**Unit 4: Triangle Relationships** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn more about triangles and their various
parts.  Triangles, believe it or not, are used more often in life than
you might think.  Triangles are often used to estimate distances.  The
process of triangulation has been used for over two thousand years; with
this technique, we can use two known locations and determine the
distance to a location that we can see but cannot necessarily get to,
like a boat out in a lake.  Today, we use triangulation for navigating
boats, surveying land, launching model rockets, and other activities.*  
  
 *We can also use triangles to map things out.  For example, city
planners often use the circumcenter of a triangle, which is a point in
the middle that is equally distant from all three sides.  They might use
this to determine the location of a major parking garage, so that it is
the same distance from three different companies, or they might want to
make sure that a city monument is in the middle of a town plaza.*  
  
 *If you live in a house, triangles are right over your heads. 
Construction workers use the midsegment of a triangle to help strengthen
roof trusses when they build.  If the truss is not supported properly,
it could collapse, leading to lots of problems for the poor homeowner.*
