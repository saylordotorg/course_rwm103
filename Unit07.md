title: "RWM103: Geometry"
course_description: "In this course, you will study the relationships between lines and angles. You will learn to calculate how much space an object covers, determine how much space is inside of a three-dimensional object, and other relationships between shapes, objects, and the mathematics that govern them."

**Unit 7: Right Triangle Trigonometry** <span id="7"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn the basics of trigonometry.  Trigonometry
is used for several different measuring techniques.  You can determine
the height of a building, for example, if you know how far away you are
standing and at what angle your eyes form when looking up to its top. 
In previous centuries, mariners could use trigonometry to help them set
their course, using the heavens as a guide.*
