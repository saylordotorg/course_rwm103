**Unit 2: Parallel and Perpendicular Lines** <span id="2"></span> 
*Simply put, parallel lines are lines in a plane that do not intersect,
while perpendicular lines are lines that intersect at a right angle
(90°).  Parallel and perpendicular lines are all around us.  For
example, railroad tracks, iron fencing, latticework, and kitchen tables
all have parallel and/or perpendicular lines.*  
  
 *Have you ever looked at a tile floor that has an intricate pattern of
crisscrossing lines?  The pattern has to be carefully replicated,
following special rules.  When parallel lines cross other lines, they
create their own set of special rules, which may be used in making these
patterns.  In this unit, you will learn what happens when parallel lines
cross other lines and how all the created angles relate to each other.*
