**Unit 6: Similarity** <span id="6"></span> 
*In this unit, you will review ratios and proportions, and you will
learn how they connect to similarity.  In the real world, you may see an
item and think that it is similar to something else, whether it is
because of the design, the size, or some other factors.  In Geometry,
however, similarity has very strict rules attached to it.  You will
learn to apply these rules to determine if two shapes, especially
triangles, are similar.*
