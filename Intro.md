Course Syllabus for "RWM103: Geometry"
--------------------------------------

“Everything is numbers.”  This phrase was uttered by the lead character,
Dr. Charlie Epps, on the hit television show “NUMB3RS.”  If everything
has a mathematical underpinning, then it follows that everything is
somehow mathematically connected, even if it is only in some odd, “six
degrees of separation (or Kevin Bacon)” kind of way. Geometry is the
study of space (for now, mainly two-dimensional, with some
three-dimensional thrown in) and the relationships of objects contained
inside.  It is one of the more relatable math courses, because it often
answers that age-old question, “When am I ever going to use this in real
life?”  Look around you right now.  Do you see any triangles?  Can you
spot any circles?  Do you see any books that look like they are twice
the size of other books?  Does your wall have paint on it? In geometry,
you will explore the objects that make up our universe.  Most people
never give a second thought to how things are constructed, but there are
geometric rules at play.  Most people never think twice about a rocket
launch, but if that rocket is not launched at an exact angle, it will
miss its target.  A football field has to be measured out to be a
rectangle; if you used another shape, such as a trapezoid, that would
give an unfair advantage to one team, because that one team would have
more space to work with. In this course, you will study the
relationships between lines and angles.  Have you ever looked at a
street map?  Believe it or not, there is a lot of geometry on a map, as
you will see from this course.  You will learn to calculate how much
space an object covers, which is useful if you ever have to, say, buy
some paint.  You will learn to determine how much space is inside of a
three-dimensional object, which is useful for those times you are trying
to fit four suitcases, three kids, two adults, and a dog into the back
of your vehicle. These are just some of the topics you will be
learning.  As you will quickly see, everything is not just numbers; it
is also relationships.  Even nature itself knows this.  What did the
little acorn say when it grew up?  “Gee, I’m a tree!”

### Learning Outcomes

*NOTE: Each of the learning outcomes listed below has been aligned with
one or more of the Common Core standards in mathematics. This alignment
is reflected in the numbered notation listed alongside each outcome

    three-dimensional objects, and identify three-dimensional objects
    generated by rotations of two-dimensional objects.
    ([HSG-GMD.B.4](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSG/GMD/B/4))

    describe objects.
    ([HSG-MG.A.1](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSG/MG/A/1))
-   Recall the formulas for the area and circumference of a circle and
    use them to solve problems.
    ([7.G.B.4](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/7/G/B/4))
-   Using facts about supplementary, complementary, vertical, and
    adjacent angles, write and solve simple equations for an unknown
    angle in a figure.
    ([7.G.B.5](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/7/G/B/5))
-   Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, volume,
    and surface area of two- and three-dimensional objects composed of
    triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes, and right prisms.

### Course Information

Welcome to RWM 103.  General information about the course and its
requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Course Designer:** Eric Clark  
  
 **Primary** **Resources:** This course is composed of a range of
different free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use
of the following materials:  

-   Salman Khan’s [Khan
    Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/) Mathematics Videos
-   CK-12: *[Geometry](http://www.ck12.org/browse/geometry/)*

    *[Geometry](http://cafreetextbooks.ck12.org/math/CK12_Geometry.pdf)*

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Please pay special attention to Units 1 and 2, as these lay the
groundwork for understanding the more advanced, exploratory material
presented in the latter units.  You will also need to complete:  

-   Subunit 1.1 Assessment
-   Sub-subunit 1.4.4 Assessment
-   Sub-subunit 1.4.5 Assessment
-   Sub-subunit 1.4.7 Assessment
-   Sub-subunit 2.2.5 Assessment
-   Subunit 3.1 Assessment
-   Sub-subunit 3.2.3 Assessment
-   Sub-subunit 3.3.5 Assessment
-   Sub-subunit 4.6.2 Assessment

-   Subunit 9.2 Assessment
-   Subunit 9.3 Assessment
-   Subunit 9.6 Assessment
-   Subunit 9.10 Assessment
-   Subunit 10.7 Assessment
-   The Final Exam

Please note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final
Exam.  However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will
need to work through the assessments listed above as well as all
resources in each unit.  
  
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you approximately a total
of **144.75 hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory”
that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each
subunit.  It may be useful to take a look at these time advisories and
determine how much time you have over the next few weeks to complete
each unit and to then set goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1
should take you 17.5 hours.  Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar
and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 3 hours) on Monday night;
subunits 1.2 and 1.3 (a total of 2.25 hours) on Tuesday night; etc.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions:** Please make sure to take comprehensive notes as
you work through each resource.  These notes will serve as a useful
review as you study for your Final Exam.  Complete all practice
problems, because practice will allow you to fully understand each
concept.
