**Unit 3: Triangles, Congruence, and Other Relationships** <span
id="3"></span> 
*Making sure that objects are of equal size is important in life. 
Whether pieces of furniture, automobiles, or just pieces of a candy bar
shared between siblings, we often have to make sure objects are the same
size and shape.*  
  
 *Have you ever had to prove something to a child?  Sometimes, the best
way to do that is to give the child a series of logical statements and
then show how it all summarizes to one conclusion.  In this unit, you
will focus on showing that two triangles are identical.  There are
different methods to doing this, and the one you use will depend upon
the information you have available to you.  It is nothing more than
following a series of logical statements and then showing how the
statements draw a conclusion.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will also learn more about triangles and their
various parts.  Triangles, believe it or not, are used more often in
life than you might think.  Triangles are often used to estimate
distances.  The process of triangulation has been used for over two
thousand years; with this technique, we can use two known locations and
determine the distance to a location that we can see but cannot
necessarily get to, like a boat out in a lake.  Today, we use
triangulation for navigating boats, surveying land, launching model
rockets, and other activities.*  
  
 *We can also use triangles to map things out.  For example, city
planners often use the circumcenter of a triangle, which is a point in
the middle that is equally distant from all three sides.  They might use
this to determine the location of a major parking garage, so that it is
the same distance from three different companies, or they might want to
make sure that a city monument is in the middle of a town plaza.*  
  
 *If you live in a house, triangles are right over your heads. 
Construction workers use the midsegment of a triangle to help strengthen
roof trusses when they build.  If the truss is not supported properly,
it could collapse, leading to lots of problems for the poor homeowner.*

    times to understand how two triangles are not congruent by
    side-side-angle.  
      
     Watching this lecture and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 30 minutes.
