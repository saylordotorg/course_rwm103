title: "RWM103: Geometry"
course_description: "In this course, you will study the relationships between lines and angles. You will learn to calculate how much space an object covers, determine how much space is inside of a three-dimensional object, and other relationships between shapes, objects, and the mathematics that govern them."

**Unit 10: Surface Area and Volume** <span id="10"></span> 
*Finding the amount of space inside of an object is important, and
something you will do in your everyday life.  If you try to fill a box
with DVDs, to fill up a sandbox, or to fill a pool with water, you will
use concept of volume.  There are more shapes than just simple boxes, so
you will learn to find the amount of space inside different types of
three-dimensional objects.*  
  
 *Finding the amount of space on the outside of an object is also
something you will do in your everyday life.  If you decide to paint
your house, you need to know how much space is going to be painted;
buying too much paint would be a waste of money, and buying too little
paint would be a nuisance.  A few minutes of calculating can ensure that
you get the amount of paint you need. *
