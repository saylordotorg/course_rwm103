**Unit 1: Basics of Geometry** <span id="1"></span> 
*From a young age, we learn basic vocabulary and basic concepts that
lead us to understand greater concepts.  In this unit, you will learn
about the basic building blocks of Geometry.*  
  
 *Everything has a proper name.  We often seem to use nicknames:
“fridge” instead of “refrigerator,” “phone” instead of “telephone,” and
so on.  Still, we know what the proper terminology is, even if we do not
use it as often as we probably should.  Knowing the meanings of several
basic terms in Geometry is important, because these terms are going to
keep popping up over and over again.  Whether it is knowing a simple
definition, or understanding the relationships between angles, these
basic items are a “must know” in Geometry.*  
  
 *In life, we also classify things.  We tend to classify by height, age,
weight, food preference, nationality, etc.  We will use pretty much
anything we can think of for classification purposes.  While some
classifications might seem unnecessary to us, others seem quite
important.  Classifying berries, for example, can help you to keep from
eating a poisonous one that would make you sick.  Without
classification, we would not have a way to keep the good ones separate
from the bad ones.  The same holds true in Geometry.  Classifying shapes
like triangles can help us recognize these shapes faster and eventually
recognize the rules and relationships pertaining to their
classification.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and take notes as you
    watch the first video to learn about linear pairs.  You do not need
    to watch the “James Sousa: Linear Pairs” video.  Watch the
    presentation carefully two or three times until you are able to
    understand problems with linear pairs.  Then, read the following
    sections: “Guidance” (omitting Linear Pairs B video), “Vocabulary,”
    and “Guided Practice.”  This section provides examples of adjacent
    angles and angles that form a linear pair.  You may also access the
    material in PDF, mobi, and ePub format by clicking on the
    appropriate link under “Download,” if you choose to create a free
    account.
