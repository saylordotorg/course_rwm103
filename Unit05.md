**Unit 5: Polygons and Quadrilaterals** <span id="5"></span> 
*Polygons are everywhere around us.  If you see a shape that has no
curves, then it is a polygon.  As a child, you probably learned the
names of many common polygons.  In this unit, you will focus on
quadrilaterals, which are polygons with four sides.  They each have
their own set of characteristics and share some characteristics with
other quadrilaterals.  You will learn to recognize these characteristics
and to use them to help you answer questions about quadrilaterals.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 16 hours to complete.
